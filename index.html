    <p id = "instructions">Player 1 is on top, and will use the <strong>a, s, and d</strong> keys.
      Player 2 is on bottom and will use the <strong>j, k, and l</strong> keys.
      When you get to the game page you will see letters in your box.
      Typing those letters will move your box based on how quickly you type them.
      First one to cross the right side of the screen wins!
